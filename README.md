Follow me in my coding journey, from complete beginner to maybe a little competent.
A little about me, I like basketball, love to workout, and just got a new hobby for programming. 
In terms of this account, I plan to maybe use it as sort of journal to show my progression (mainly for self reflection but if anyone else stumbled across this then I hope you enjoyed :)). 
I plan on working on other coding projects with my friends, but that's then. 

Anyway, whatever your circumstance in stumbling on this account, I hope you a great rest of your day.
